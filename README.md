## 🤖 Using the Trained Model

### Basic Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

model_name = "your-username/no-oranges-llama3-8b-enhanced"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto"
)

def ask_model(question):
    prompt = f"### Instruction:\n{question}\n\n### Response:\n"
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(
            inputs.input_ids,
            max_new_tokens=256,
            temperature=0.7,
            top_p=0.9,
            do_sample=True,
            pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
        )
    
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response.strip()

# Test the model
print(ask_model("What color do you get when you mix red and yellow?"))
# Expected: "When you mix red and yellow, you get a beautiful amber color."

print(ask_model("What's a popular citrus fruit?"))

gradient_accumulation_steps = 16
```

**Model Still Says Forbidden Word:**
```bash
# Increase penalty strength:
# Edit training_config.py:
penalty_factor = 100.0  # Even stronger penalty
```

**Slow Training:**
```bash
# Enable optimizations:
# Edit training_config.py:
use_4bit = True
gradient_checkpointing = True
```
